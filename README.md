## 🚀 What is Meridian?
 
**Meridian** is an open blogging platform designed exclusively for engineers and tech enthusiasts. Unlike Medium or Hashnode — where algorithmic feeds and follower counts dictate who gets read — Meridian is built around **peer-driven discovery**, **technical integrity**, and **long-term value**.

## ✨ Core USPs
 
### 1. 🎯 Stack-Matched Discovery
> *"Write once, reach the exact team that needs it."*
 
Posts are intelligently matched to engineers based on their current tech stack, pulled from GitHub and LinkedIn integrations. A post about Kafka tuning lands in front of engineers actively working with Kafka — not random followers.
 
- Tag posts with technologies used
- Readers opt into their active stack profile
- Zero wasted impressions; 100% relevant reach
---
 
### 2. ⏱️ Living Posts — Your Writing Doesn't Expire
> *"Your best posts don't go stale."*
 
Technical content has a shelf life. Meridian lets the community submit *patches* to outdated posts — like a pull request but for writing. Articles stay accurate, keep ranking, and keep helping.
 
- Community-submitted corrections and updates
- Author approves/rejects patches via a PR-style interface
- Version history for every post
---
 
### 3. 🤝 Collaborative Forking
> *"Co-author with engineers you've never met."*
 
A GitHub-style forking model for blog posts. Fork someone's article, improve it, add your perspective, and publish your version with full attribution. Collaborative technical writing, not just solo publishing.
 
- One-click fork any post
- Full attribution chain preserved
- Merge suggestions back to the original author
---
 
### 4. 🏆 Impact-Based Reputation & Global Ranking
> *"Your rank reflects your real-world impact, not your follower count."*

Writers earn points when the community engages with their work in meaningful ways —
forks, reposts, and real-world usage. Points fuel a global engineer reputation rank,
weighted by the contributor's own standing. Game the leaderboard by writing better, not louder.

- **Point system driven by peer impact:**
<div align="center">
| Action | Points |
|---|---|
| Someone forks your post | +10 |
| Someone reposts your post | +5 |
| "Used at work" reaction on your post | +15 |
| Your patch gets accepted on another's post | +8 |
| Your mentee publishes successfully | +12 |
</div>

- Points from high-ranked engineers carry **more weight** — preventing gaming
- Global leaderboard with **rank tiers:**
  `Newcomer → Contributor → Engineer → Senior → Architect → Fellow`
- Rank influences **post visibility** — higher ranked authors surface higher in discovery feeds

---
 
### 5. 🧪 Claim Verification
> *"Every claim is linked to a proof."*
 
A structured post format where technical assertions must link to code, benchmarks, or papers. Readers can instantly verify claims. Builds a culture of honest, rigorous engineering writing.
 
- Inline citation system for code snippets and benchmarks
- "Unverified claim" flag raised by community
- Credibility score per author based on verification rate
---
 
### 6. 🗣️ Posts That Talk Back
> *"Blog posts that evolve into documentation."*
 
Each post has a structured Q&A section — not a comment section, but threaded questions the author answers. Posts grow into living, searchable documentation over time.
 
- Structured Q&A separate from general comments
- Author answers are highlighted and indexed
- Posts auto-generate an FAQ section from resolved threads
---
 
### 7. 🧭 Writing as Your Portfolio
> *"Your writing becomes your engineering CV."*
 
Every post you publish is parsed for technologies, concepts, and depth — auto-building a verified skills profile. Recruiters search Meridian not for resumes, but for *thinkers*.
 
- Auto-generated skills graph from post content
- Public author profile with verified expertise tags
- Recruiter search tier (opt-in only)
---
 
### 8. 🌱 Mentored Publishing for Beginners
> *"No expertise required to be heard."*
 
A dedicated track for junior engineers — posts are reviewed and mentored by senior volunteers before going live. Beginners get expert feedback AND visibility, without fear of public criticism.
 
- Submit to "Mentored Track" before publishing
- Matched with a senior reviewer in your domain
- Reviewer credit shown on the published post
